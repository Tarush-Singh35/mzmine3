## GSoC 2022 review

### Ion Mobility Data Format Support

Most of the commits are in the branch at: https://github.com/Tarush-Singh35/mzmine3/tree/waterdevclean
and at the corresponding pull request: https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/pull/763


In this Project, we Added the Support of the Water API so that the Users can import the waterâ€™s raw data and read the file. We Implemented the APIs using Water SDK and the Solution we came up with was to have an Intermediate scan to read the regular file in raw data file with no mobility and an Intermediate frame to read the ion mobility file in the Raw file. After implementation, the User is able to read metadata from both of these file and able to import the files.


While building a more robust Import Task for MZmine. I was not able to implement different type of msmsInfo for the precursor due to data model restriction in Mzmine hence with new Data model Import Task has the potential to improve

### Result



Acknowledgments:
I want to thank my mentor, Steffen Heu, for their dedicated guidance and support throughout the project. I have learned much about MZmine 3 ecosystem and coding conventions, Code optimizations, Chemistry, Mass Spectroscopy, JavaFx, and the patch submission process. Also, I would like to thank all the reviewers for their code reviews and helpful comments on my patches. Special thanks to all MZmine3 community members for their advice and for providing a welcoming environment.

![Build Status](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/actions/workflows/gradle.yml/badge.svg?event=push)

MZmine is an open-source software for mass-spectrometry data processing. The goals of the project is
to provide a user-friendly, flexible and easily extendable software with a complete set of modules
covering the entire MS data analysis workflow.

More information about the software can be found on the [MZmine](http://mzmine.github.io) website.

## Releases

[Releases](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/releases?q=&expanded=true) are split into [stable releases](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/releases/latest)
and
the [latest development build](https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/releases/tag/Development-release)
which reflects the current state of the master branch and is meant for testing purposes. Download
options include portable versions and installers for the Window, macOS, and Linux.

### Running on macOS

Currently, MZmine 3 lacks a signature for macOS. While we are working on this, user can allow MZmine
in the macOS Gatekeeper protection by running the following command in the terminal from the folder
containing the .app.

```
sudo xattr -cr MZmine.app
```

## Development

### Tutorial

Please read our brief [tutorial](http://mzmine.github.io/development.html) on how to contribute new
code to MZmine.

### Java version

MZmine development requires Java Development Kit (JDK) version 16 or newer (http://jdk.java.net).

### Building

To build the MZmine package from the sources, run the following command:

    ./gradlew

or

    gradlew.bat

The final MZmine distribution will be placed in build/jpackage

If you encounter any problems, please contact the developers:
https://github.com/mzmine/mzmine3/issues

### Code style

Since this is a collaborative project, please adhere to the following code formatting conventions:

* We use the Google Java Style Guide (https://github.com/google/styleguide)
* Please write JavaDoc comments as full sentences, starting with a capital letter and ending with a
  period. Brevity is preferred (e.g., "Calculates standard deviation" is preferred over "This method
  calculates and returns a standard deviation of given set of numbers").
